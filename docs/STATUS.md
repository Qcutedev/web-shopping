# Status

The only place task status is recorded. Owner: orchestrator. Task definitions are in [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md).

Last updated: 2026-10-22 (trimmed after the ninety-seventh session). The per-session history, the old change log, the answered owner questions (OQ-01 to OQ-50, answers in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) D-025 to D-028), and the old test-result table were removed from this file on purpose. They are in git: run `git log --oneline -- docs/STATUS.md` and `git show <commit>:docs/STATUS.md`. Review findings live in [reviews/](reviews/) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Summary

Done: foundation, database schema, auth, catalog, storefront pages, profile and addresses, cart, uploads, seller UI, seller isolation tests, concurrency tests. Several of these are IMPLEMENTED but not VERIFIED (code review or security re-check or browser check still open).

Not started: checkout UI (T-034), reviews, seller onboarding and seller products/orders, the whole admin area, the E2E suite, CI, Dockerfile, security headers, docs audit, final acceptance. Nothing has been deployed.

## Resume here

Session 100 started. Running now: qa (SEC-079, CR-162 to CR-164; paths: tests/**, e2e/**, docs/SECURITY.md), frontend (CR-165, CR-166; paths: src/components/** product form and image editor, src/i18n/th.ts), backend-api (SEC-056, SEC-053; paths: src/modules/payments, src/modules/cart, docs/API_CONTRACTS.md). If interrupted, inspect uncommitted files before relaunching.

Read first in a new session: CLAUDE.md, this file, `git status`, `git diff`.

Done in session 99: SEC-078 re-checked and FIXED (`docs/SECURITY.md`, `tests/security/sec078-recheck.test.ts`). New SEC-079 (Low, open): e2e env scanner reads one line at a time, 24 multi-line dotenv forms missed; fix by parsing with `@next/env`, then flip the `it.fails` in `sec078-recheck.test.ts` (qa). Code review of `a202868`, `914cb39`, `894c7c9`: APPROVE, non-blocking items only (CR-162 to CR-166 below). T-032 found already built and reviewed in earlier sessions; its STATUS row was stale.

CR-162: `tests/helpers/test-database-url.ts:299` "equal to DATABASE_URL" message ignores `prefix`/`where` (CR-158 incomplete; integration message must stay unchanged, pinned by `tests/integration/harness/test-database-url.test.ts:180,185`). CR-163: `dashboard-store.test.tsx:333` test name does not match what it tests. CR-164: lock tests do not assert errors/formMessage are cleared. CR-165: late `ImageSetEditor` upload can write into a locked `ProductForm`. CR-166: create-mode `ProductForm` resets the draft on suspension (confirm intended).

Owner decisions (2026-10-22): SEC-056 block the mock provider when NODE_ENV=production (backend-api); SEC-053 cap a cart at 50 distinct lines (backend-api, then update CR-T032-12); CR-166 keep the create-mode draft on suspension, lock without resetting (frontend, with CR-165).

Next, in order:
1. qa: SEC-079, CR-162 to CR-164. frontend: CR-165. backend-api: SEC-056, SEC-053.
2. T-032 follow-ups: CR-T032-10 import-guard probe (security); T-033 CC-12; T-032 and T-031 code-review/security status still need re-checking.
3. T-034 checkout UI; seller and admin work.

Do not run two e2e suites at once: they share database `marketplace_e2e` and port 3100.

Agents must not type backslash-u escapes in tool input: the tool turns them into real invisible characters (likely how U+FEFF reached SECURITY.md). Generate them from code points in a script.

Last known test results (session 99): `pnpm test:integration` 1357 passed, 7 expected fail; security project 1195 passed, 6 expected fail; session 98 `pnpm test` 4597 passed, 5 expected fail (not re-run with the new security test); `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck` exit 0. e2e not run this session.

Standing rules from the owner (D-019): never guess, park questions here and ask in batches; commit locally after each task passes its checks, never push without being told; stop for owner review at the five milestones.

## Open owner decisions

| Id | Decision | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OQ-20 | Design details to confirm on real pages (input text size 15 or 16 px, chip and search height, required-field marking, sold-out quantity selector, negative amounts, error summary) | DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Others from session 91 | SEC-072, SR-02 split, SEC-064, SEC-066, seller header link, SEC-073 residual (a/b/c), `th.ts` proposal strings, mobile sort. They may have been answered since; check before asking | old STATUS.md in git, [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |

## Blockers

| Id | Blocker | Blocks | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-04 | No GitHub remote; `gh` not logged in | T-070 cannot be verified on a real run | Owner runs `gh auth login`, then creates the repository; CI can be written but not proven until then |

## Environment

Windows 11, PowerShell. Node v24.20.0, pnpm 12.11.2, Docker 29.8.2 with Compose v5.5.1 (daemon was up in session 96), PostgreSQL 18 through Docker only, `gh` 2.102.0 installed. Project at `C:\dev\web shoping`, outside OneDrive. Details: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), D-020.

## Tasks

Notes marked "stale?" were written while Docker was down; later sessions ran the integration suite, but these rows were never re-checked, so they are not VERIFIED.
