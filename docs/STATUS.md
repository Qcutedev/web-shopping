# Status

The only place task status is recorded. Owner: orchestrator. Task definitions are in [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md).

Last updated: 2026-10-22 (trimmed after the ninety-seventh session). The per-session history, the old change log, the answered owner questions (OQ-01 to OQ-50, answers in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) D-025 to D-028), and the old test-result table were removed from this file on purpose. They are in git: run `git log --oneline -- docs/STATUS.md` and `git show <commit>:docs/STATUS.md`. Review findings live in [reviews/](reviews/) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Summary

Done: foundation, database schema, auth, catalog, storefront pages, profile and addresses, cart, uploads, seller UI, seller isolation tests, concurrency tests. Several of these are IMPLEMENTED but not VERIFIED (code review or security re-check or browser check still open).

Not started: checkout UI (T-034), reviews, seller onboarding and seller products/orders, the whole admin area, the E2E suite, CI, Dockerfile, security headers, docs audit, final acceptance. Nothing has been deployed.

## Resume here


Session 105 finished. No agent is running. Local commits, not pushed.

Read first in a new session: CLAUDE.md, this file, `git status`, `git diff`.

Done in session 105: qa `908f5af`, `7f6111a` (48 new tests in `tests/integration/checkout/cc-remaining.test.ts`: CC-04, CC-05, CC-07, CC-10, CC-11, CC-14, CC-06 seller side; 48 passed, neighbours 264 passed; no mutation run yet). Frontend (no commit): T-034 typecheck, lint, `pnpm test` 4828 passed, `pnpm build` ok, browser check at 360/768/1280 px on /checkout, /orders, /cart (success and failed-payment paths). Security `374ca0b`: SEC-081 stays OPEN, new SEC-083 (Low).

Open:
- Owner approval of changed Thai strings (`src/i18n/th.ts`): `orders.confirmation.failedBody` and `failedTimeoutBody` lost the "items back in cart" sentence (now in `cartReturnBody`, shown only when items exist); checkout lowered line uses OQ-46 `th.quantity.lowered`; unknown-stock refusal uses `th.errors.insufficientStock`.
- T-034 review item "cart-write INSUFFICIENT_STOCK sold-out copy": confirm with reviewer intent. T-034 browser check did not cover empty cart, INSUFFICIENT_STOCK refusal, list failure, skeletons; no e2e.
- SEC-081 OPEN. Needs fixes (see SECURITY.md): `noInlineConfig` for all code; refuse `module`/`global`/`globalThis`/`Reflect`/`__non_webpack_require__` except as member-access object, refuse `.constructor` and computed binary/template keys (orchestrator, `eslint.config.mjs`); add probes to `scripts/check-import-guards.mjs` (devops). SEC-083 (Low): block `src` imports of `scripts|tests|e2e|prisma`. Then flip `it.fails` in `tests/security/sec081-recheck-2.test.ts`; security re-checks. Owner: accept name-based residual in writing or commission a module-graph check. SEC-082 (Low, qa) open. Flake: `t032-sec055-item1-recheck.test.ts` under load.
- Frontend: Thai copy for ADDRESS_LIMIT in `src/i18n/th.ts` and address form; product-requirements approves copy first.
- T-033 CC-08, CC-09, CC-13 and CC-06 admin half blocked until T-050 to T-053 (no admin code). TEST_STRATEGY open item T12 (deactivated admin in-flight request) is open.
- Header shows no cart count for signed-in user (header not wired to session); no add-to-cart UI yet. `pnpm build` and `next dev` share `.next`: do not run together.
- Test data left in `marketplace_dev`: about 4 customers `bc*@example.com`/`bs*@example.com` and 2 orders.
- Suggested: move payment transitions out of public `src/modules/orders/index.ts` (backend-api). Residual: `returnItemToCart` has no 50-line cap. Auth startup-hook tests may time out under load.

Next, in order:
1. SEC-081/SEC-083 guard fixes (devops), security re-check.
2. Seller products/orders, admin area (T-050 to T-053), then the blocked CC cases.
3. E2E, CI.

Do not run two e2e suites at once: they share database `marketplace_e2e` and port 3100.

Agents must not type backslash-u escapes in tool input: the tool turns them into real invisible characters. Generate them from code points in a script.

Last known test results (session 102): `pnpm verify` ok after SEC-081 change; security project 1291 passed earlier in session; e2e not run.

Standing rules from the owner (D-019): never guess, park questions here and ask in batches; commit locally after each task passes its checks, never push without being told; stop for owner review at the five milestones.

## Open owner decisions

| Id | Decision | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OQ-20 | Design details to confirm on real pages (input text size 15 or 16 px, chip and search height, required-field marking, sold-out quantity selector, negative amounts, error summary) | DESIGN_SYSTEM.md |
| Others from session 91 | SEC-072, SR-02 split, SEC-064, SEC-066, seller header link, SEC-073 residual (a/b/c), `th.ts` proposal strings, mobile sort. They may have been answered since; check before asking | old STATUS.md in git, [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |

## Blockers

| Id | Blocker | Blocks | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-04 | No GitHub remote; `gh` not logged in | T-070 cannot be verified on a real run | Owner runs `gh auth login`, then creates the repository; CI can be written but not proven until then |

## Environment

Windows 11, PowerShell. Node v24.20.0, pnpm 12.11.2, Docker 29.8.2 with Compose v5.5.1 (daemon was up in session 96), PostgreSQL 18 through Docker only, `gh` 2.102.0 installed. Project at `C:\dev\web shoping`, outside OneDrive. Details: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md), D-020.

## Tasks

Notes marked "stale?" were written while Docker was down; later sessions ran the integration suite, but these rows were never re-checked, so they are not VERIFIED.
